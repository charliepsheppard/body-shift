## Project Description

This is an application that is focused on being productive when it comes to your health. The entire purpose is to be able to have all of your meal prep and workouts in one place so you can more consistantly follow through with your health goals. Users participate in "Sprints", where they add information about their meals and workouts for the duration of the sprint. Users are also able to create a blog in order to record their experience during their sprint. This allows them to reflect on what they accomplished or what they could work on in the future.
